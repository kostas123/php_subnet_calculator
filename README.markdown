<h1 style="font-weight: bold;">PHP subnet calculator</h1>
The original code was written by Raymond Ferguson , so all credits goes
to him .<br>
I made a few modifications on the code , now it is also compatible
with&nbsp; PHP &gt;= 5.3 .<br>
<br>
Note :<br>
Although this script isn't perfect , it can help out to quickly
calculate subnet-shemas ( number of hosts , broadcast domain , network
id ) .<br>
Bugs :&nbsp; Even if&nbsp; you try to resolve a Class C with an
CIDR&nbsp; lower than 24&nbsp; , let say 18 , it will calculate output .<br>
